    "text": "Concomitant, research on DPE performance has not reached a theoretical convergence: First, each of the DPE research fields brings their own isolated foci and lenses to the scene, studying diverse issues such  as  governance  mechanisms  and  boundary  resource  design  (Karhu  et  al.  2018),  network externalities and competition (Rochet and Tirole 2003), and technology leadership or transitions (Ozalp et al. 2018). Second, financial measures dominate empirical research on performance. It is equated with various metrics, such as market share or transaction volume, thereby mainly taking a profit-oriented, nontechnological  governance  perspective  that  neglects  anteceding  influences.",
