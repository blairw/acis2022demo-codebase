Second, financial measures dominate empirical research on performance. It is equated with various metrics, such as market share or transaction volume, thereby mainly taking a profit-oriented, nontechnological  governance  perspective  that  neglects  anteceding  influences.","Problematising existing research on DPE, including multiple references."
